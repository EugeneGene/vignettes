mrgsolve is an R package for simulation from hierarchical, ordinary differential 
equation (ODE) based models typically employed in drug development.

This website contains (hopefully) helpful vignettes to help you learn and 
use mrgsolve to get your simulation work done.  We keep the vignettes here
rather than in the package so they can be better maintained and 
kept up to date.

The purpose of the vignettes page is to provide documentation 
for use of stable and core features of the package. There may be content overlap in the vignette and [blog](https://mrgsolve.github.io/blog) content Feel free to comment on any of the content or report other issues in the issue tracker. The source code for all posts can be found here.
